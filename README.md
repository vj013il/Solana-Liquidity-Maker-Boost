# DeFi Analytics Bot

Welcome to the DeFi Analytics Bot, a powerful open-source tool designed for DeFi investors and yield farmers to analyze and optimize their decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies. This bot provides real-time insights into liquidity pools, lending markets, and yield farming opportunities across top protocols like Uniswap V3, SushiSwap, Aave, Curve, Balancer, Compound, and Arbitrum (Layer 2). With advanced analytics, risk assessment, and an interactive dashboard, it empowers users to make data-driven decisions for maximizing APY (Annual Percentage Yield) while minimizing risks like impermanent loss (IL).
